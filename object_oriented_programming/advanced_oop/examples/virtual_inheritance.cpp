// With virtual inheritance, D doesn't have to choose between B's or C's version of A - there's only one instance of A in D. Any method or data member from A will be accessed unambiguously through D.

// When D accesses a method or data member in A, it uses the one it has inherited through the virtual inheritance pathway. In other words, D doesn't "see" a separate version of A via B and another via C - there's just one shared A that's common to B and C.

// Here's a simple example of how it works:
class A {
public:
    void foo() { std::cout << "A::foo\n"; }
};

class B : virtual public A {
public:
    void foo() { std::cout << "B::foo\n"; }
};

class C : virtual public A {
public:
    void foo() { std::cout << "C::foo\n"; }
};

class D : public B, public C {
public:
    // D doesn't need to override foo, but it can:
    void foo() { std::cout << "D::foo\n"; }
};

int main() {
    D d;
    d.foo(); // prints "D::foo"
}

// In this code, if D doesn't provide its own implementation of foo, and you call d.foo(), you would get a compile error, because the compiler doesn't know whether to use B::foo or C::foo. If B and C didn't override foo, and you call d.foo(), it would unambiguously call A::foo.

// To explicitly call B's or C's version of foo, you can use a qualified-id:
