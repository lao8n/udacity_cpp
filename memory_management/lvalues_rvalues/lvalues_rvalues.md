5 different types of expression, or value categories.

Lvalues = have an address that can be accessed, expressions whose evaluation by the compiler determines the identify of objections or functions. Lvalues are named containers for rvalues

Prvalues (also known as rvalues)= do not have an address that is accessible directly. They are temporary expressions used to initialize objects or compute the value of an operand or operator

`int i = 42; // lvalue = rvalue`

R-references pave the way for move semantics and efficient dynamic allocation from one object to another and supports the concept of exclusive ownership. Big change brought in by C++11
